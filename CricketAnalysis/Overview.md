### **Step 0: Project Setup**
- **Objective:** The project's goal is to analyze cricket data from the T20 World Cup and build a Power BI dashboard to visualize player performance.
- **Data Source:** The data is scraped from ESPNcricinfo, a popular website that provides detailed cricket match statistics.
- **Tools and Technologies:**
    - **Web Scraping:** JavaScript and Bright Data.
    - **Data Transformation:** Python, Pandas.
    - **Data Visualization:** Power BI.
    - **File Formats:** JSON for raw data, CSV for processed data.

### **Step 1: Web Scraping**
- **Purpose:** The first step is to collect raw data from the ESPNcricinfo website.
- **Methodology:**
    - **Bright Data:** This tool is used to navigate ESPNcricinfo and scrape the required data, including match summaries, batting and bowling statistics, and player information.
    - **JavaScript Code:** The scraping process is automated using JavaScript, which runs in the browser to extract data from specific HTML elements (like tables and rows).
    - **Data Storage:** The scraped data is initially stored in JSON format.

### **Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation**
- **Purpose:** Convert the raw JSON data into a more structured format (CSV) suitable for analysis and visualization.
- **Methodology:**
    - **Pandas in Python:** Python's Pandas library is used for data cleaning. This involves:
        - **Flattening JSON Data:** Convert nested JSON objects into flat tables, where each row corresponds to a specific player’s performance or match result.
        - **Handling Missing Values:** Identify and fill missing data points, such as player dismissal information.
        - **Data Manipulation:** Create new columns (e.g., "out/not out" status) and rename existing ones for clarity.
        - **Data Export:** The cleaned and transformed data is saved as CSV files.

### **Step 3: Data Modeling in Power BI**
- **Purpose:** Establish relationships between different datasets to enable comprehensive analysis.
- **Methodology:**
    - **Import CSV Files:** The cleaned CSV files are imported into Power BI.
    - **Establish Relationships:** Fact tables (e.g., batting and bowling summaries) are linked with dimension tables (e.g., player information) using unique identifiers like match IDs and player names.
    - **Data Modeling:** This step ensures that the data is correctly structured, enabling meaningful visualizations.

### **Step 4: Creating DAX Measures**
- **Purpose:** Develop custom metrics (DAX measures) to enhance data analysis in Power BI.
- **Methodology:**
    - **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** DAX is used to create measures like:
        - **Total Runs:** Sum of runs scored by a player.
        - **Strike Rate:** Calculated as (total runs/total balls faced) * 100.
        - **Boundary Percentage:** Percentage of runs scored from boundaries.
    - **Grouping Measures:** Related measures are grouped into folders (e.g., "Batting," "Bowling") for easy access during visualization.

### **Step 5: Building the Power BI Dashboard**
- **Purpose:** Visualize the analyzed data to identify key player performances and trends.
- **Methodology:**
    - **Page Layout:** Create multiple pages within the dashboard, each focusing on different player roles (e.g., Power Hitters, Anchors, Fast Bowlers).
    - **Filters and Slicers:** Apply filters to narrow down player selections based on criteria like batting average, strike rate, or bowling economy.
    - **Visualizations:** Use different types of charts (bar charts, scatter plots, trend lines) to represent the data visually.
    - **Interactive Elements:** Add interactivity to the dashboard so users can explore data by applying different filters and observing changes in real-time.

### **Step 6: Final Analysis and Team Selection**
- **Purpose:** Use the dashboard to make data-driven decisions for selecting the best T20 World Cup team.
- **Methodology:**
    - **Scenario Analysis:** Compare the performance of different players under various conditions using the interactive dashboard.
    - **Final Selection:** Based on the visualizations and metrics, select the final list of players who meet the criteria for various roles (e.g., openers, middle-order batsmen, fast bowlers).
    - **Presentation:** The final dashboard presents the selected team along with supporting data to justify the choices.

### **Step 7: Presentation and Review**
- **Purpose:** Summarize the insights and share them with stakeholders.
- **Methodology:**
    - **Dashboard Review:** Ensure that the dashboard meets the project's objectives and effectively communicates the insights.
    - **Stakeholder Presentation:** Prepare a presentation (possibly using the dashboard itself) to explain how the data-driven analysis led to the final team selection.

### **Key Learning Outcomes:**
- **Understanding Data Pipelines:** From data collection to final presentation, you’ll gain insight into the complete data analysis workflow.
- **Proficiency with Tools:** The project helps in mastering web scraping, data transformation with Pandas, and data visualization in Power BI.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The dashboard allows for making informed decisions based on statistical evidence rather than intuition.

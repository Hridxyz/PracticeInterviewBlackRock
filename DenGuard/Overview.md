### 1. **Project Conceptualization (Step 0)**
- **Objective**: The project aims to create a web-based platform that visualizes and analyzes dengue fever trends across India, providing insights into the spread of the disease and the impact of vaccination efforts.
- **Target Users**: Public health officials, researchers, and the general public who want to stay informed about dengue trends.

### 2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**
- **Tools**: Python (for backend), Flask (web framework), Pandas (data manipulation), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (data visualization), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend).
- **Environment Setup**:
    - Install Python and necessary libraries (`Flask`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, etc.).
    - Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    - Create a project directory structure:
        - `templates/`: Store HTML files.
        - `static/`: Store CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
        - Main Python files (`app.py`, `dengue.py`) and data files (`.csv` files).

### 3. **Data Collection and Preparation**
- **Dengue Data (`dengue_india.csv`)**:
    - Contains data about dengue cases across different states/union territories in India, including fields like confirmed cases, cured cases, deaths, and dates.
- **Vaccination Data (`dengue_vaccine_statewise.csv`)**:
    - Contains records of vaccinations administered across states, detailing the number of individuals vaccinated by gender and age groups.

### 4. **Backend Development**
- **Data Analysis and Processing (`dengue.py`)**:
    - **Load Data**: The data from the CSV files is loaded into pandas DataFrames.
    - **Data Cleaning**: Unnecessary columns are dropped, and dates are formatted properly.
    - **Calculating Metrics**: New metrics like active cases are calculated by subtracting the sum of cured and deceased cases from confirmed cases.
    - **State-wise Analysis**: Data is aggregated by states to get the maximum number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations, and recovery/mortality rates are calculated.
    - **Visualizations**: Bar charts, line plots, and pie charts are created to visualize the data.
- **Web Application Setup (`app.py`)**:
    - **Flask Setup**: Flask is used to create a web server that will handle HTTP requests.
    - **Routes**: Different routes are defined to serve the homepage and other pages like statistics.
    - **Data Visualizations**: The charts created in `dengue.py` are rendered dynamically when the user visits the statistics page.
    - **Serving Content**: The content (charts, images) is served to the frontend via Flask routes.

### 5. **Frontend Development**
- **HTML Structure (`home.html`)**:
    - **Layout**: The HTML file structures the content with a header, navigation bar, featured section, and main content area.
    - **Navigation Links**: Links for different sections (Health Topics, Outbreaks, Data & Stats) are provided, which will dynamically load content.
- **Styling (`home.css`)**:
    - **Responsive Design**: CSS ensures that the website is visually appealing and works well on different screen sizes.
    - **Colors & Fonts**: The design uses specific colors and fonts to maintain consistency and readability.
- **Interactivity (`home.js`)**:
    - **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript is used to dynamically load content into the main content area when users interact with the navigation links.
    - **Sliders**: A slider is set up to display different images or content sections interactively.
    - **Charts Interaction**: Users can click on images representing different statistics to see more details, which are loaded dynamically.

### 6. **Testing**
- **Local Testing**:
    - Run the application locally using Flask (`python app.py`).
    - Test all routes to ensure they load the correct pages.
    - Interact with the webpage to verify that all dynamic content loads correctly.
    - Check that data visualizations are accurate and responsive.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**:
    - Ensure that the site works across different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- **Performance Testing**:
    - Test the applicationâ€™s performance, especially how quickly the visualizations load.

### 7. **Deployment**
- **Hosting**:
    - Deploy the Flask application on a web server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or a dedicated server).
    - Ensure that all dependencies are installed on the server.
- **Domain Setup**:
    - If needed, set up a custom domain name for the application.
- **Final Testing**:
    - Test the live application to ensure everything works as expected after deployment.

### 8. **Final Deliverables**
- **Web Application**: A fully functional web platform that provides visual insights into dengue trends in India.
- **Documentation**:
    - README file providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage.
    - Comments within the code for clarity and future maintenance.

### 9. **Ongoing Maintenance**
- **Data Updates**:
    - Regular updates to the dengue and vaccination data as new data becomes available.
- **Bug Fixes**:
    - Address any issues or bugs reported by users.
- **Feature Enhancements**:
    - Potential future enhancements could include additional data filters, more detailed analyses, or user account features.
